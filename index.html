            <h1>Julia Gasanova</h1>
            <p>
                I’m a hands-on Senior Software Engineer with 14+ years of experience building robust, scalable software across industries.
                I turn complex business challenges into clear, effective solutions - from architecture and development to production support - delivering systems that work reliably and drive real results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve designed, built, and maintained data-driven applications, web services, APIs, and complex enterprise systems, including their underlying data architecture, ETL pipelines, and data engineering solutions.
                I’ve worked across many technologies, quickly mastering new tools, and constantly evolving my technical expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work has never been just about writing code - it has always been about solving real-life problems.
                My approach starts with deep analysis and Identifying the root cause and business needs, assessment of possible solutions and approaches and choosing the optimal one to design and implement solutions that are both effective and maintainable, even under tight deadlines and technological constraints.
                Every project starts with understanding the problem - and ends with a solution that delivers measurable impact.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I began my career as a software engineer at one of the largest telecommunications operators in Ukraine, developing a wide range of software for call center operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I provided ongoing support for 20+ production systems serving the operator’s internal hotlines and external outsourcing clients, covering IVR (Interactive Voice Response) solutions and call-center operator software for call handling and processing.
                I delivered end-to-end implementation of new call-center hotline projects, from initial design to production rollout. 
                I also developed software for internal call-center processes automation, built integration solutions and APIs for cross-system communication, and designed database architectures, data warehouses, ETL workflows, and data pipelines for large-scale data processing, supporting advanced analytics and dozens of reports and dashboards.
                As well as delivered specialized solutions such as systems for displaying operational information on screens across operator rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my six years at the company, I advanced from a junior engineer to the head of the department.
                In this role, I managed team capacity and priorities, mentored engineers, and combined hands-on technical work with people leadership and strategic decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                I led key automation initiatives for internal call-center processes, reducing manual effort by over 75% and significantly improving operational efficiency.
                And one of my greatest leadership achievements was the development and implementation outbound calling system based on the open source platform Asterisk, which allowed the company to reduce the costs of software and hardware expansion of outbound calling by more than 80%.

            <p>
                For more than seven years, I worked for a company developing software for government and social institutions, contributing to e-government initiatives and large-scale social benefit payment systems.
                One of the key projects was the automated system for pension assignment and payments for the Pension Fund of Ukraine.
                I also worked on multiple reporting development projects and led the technical development of a centralized integration system that integrated multiple business applications for social benefit payments, including the Pension Found system.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was involved across the full lifecycle of the large-scale, mission-critical systems development, including maintenance and implementation of significant changes and improvements to a high-load system in production operation.
                I built integration solutions and APIs enabling data exchange between internal systems and external platforms, including e-government services and banks.
                My role also had a strong data focus.
                I designed ETL processes and data pipelines, built and evolved data warehouses, implemented solutions for processing large datasets, and developed complex reports, dashboards, and forecasting solutions to support data-driven decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my accomplishments was making a significant contribution to the migration of high-load production system of Pension Fund of Ukraine from Oracle APEX to ASP.NET, preserving all existing functionality while introducing new features and ensuring a seamless transition for end users.
                I also designed and implemented numerous data warehouses which reducing report generation time by over 50-70% and freeing the production system from peak loads during periods of active report generation.
                And designed by me centralized integration system allowed to improve operational efficiency and lessened manual effort by more than 30%.

                Another project I contributed to was the development of software solutions for logistics process automation, where I developed a set of applications operating as an integrated ecosystem.
                These applications communicated with internal components as well as multiple external systems, requiring careful design of interfaces and data flows.
                My responsibilities covered API development, ETL processes, and data pipeline implementation, along with the development of reports and dashboards for operational insight.
                Alongside back-end and integration work, I contributed significantly to front-end development, building rich user interfaces that balanced functionality, usability, and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                A major achievement on this project was the independent design and implementation of a software solution that consolidated and replaced two legacy systems.
